  <h1>Aayusha ❤️</h1>
  <p>
    These past 6–7 months with you have been really special to me.  
    You are charming, beautiful, and stunning in every way, but what truly made me fall for you is your heart and the way you make everything feel warm and real.

    <br><br>
    I know you worry about long distance and about ruining what we already have. But I don’t see this as something that will break us. I believe we can figure things out together. Instead of letting fear or distance ruin what we share, I want us to grow through it, step by step.

    <br><br>
    I don’t expect perfection. I just want honesty, patience, and effort. I promise I will always try to protect what we have, not destroy it. I want to be there for you in your highs and your lows, and I want you to always feel safe with me, no matter the distance.

    <br><br>
    I just wanted you to know how much you truly mean to me ❤️
